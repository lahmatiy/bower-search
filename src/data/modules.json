Though the script is quick and easy to setup, it offers great flexibility in both behaviour and styling.  It was designed as an alternative to the often-seen JavaScript image lightbox (see Lightbox 2, Fancybox or Colorbox, just to name a few). What they all have in common: they employ a modal window to display the large images, thus disrupting the workflow of the user interacting with a webpage.  jQuery.popeye takes a different approach: not only allows it for browsing all thumbnails as well as the large images in a single image space, it also repects the page flow and stays anchored and rooted in the webpage at all times, thus giving a less disruptive user experience than modal windows.","owner":"pi3r","website":"https://github.com/pi3r/jQuery.popeye","forks":0,"stars":10,"created":"2011-06-06T09:57:19Z","updated":"2011-06-06T10:03:57Z"},{"name":"popcorn-js","description":"The
