# [Bower search](http://bower.io/search)

> Search for [Bower](http://bower.io) packages

Make sure to include [`keywords` in your bower.json](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1APq7oA9tNao1UYWyOm8dKqlRP2blVkROYLZ2fLIjtWc/edit#heading=h.gexwkmadfy56) as the search will make use of those.

Check out the [back-end](https://github.com/bower/search-server) to see how the data is aggregated.

It usually takes an hour for new components to show up on the site.

*Issues regarding packages should be reported on the [Bower repo](https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/new).*
